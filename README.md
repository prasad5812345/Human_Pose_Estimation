## 🚀 Usage



### Running Inference
To run the python files:
```bash
python [file_name].py
```

To test the model on images or video streams, use:
```bash
python inference.py --input [input_file_or_webcam] --output [output_path]
```

To run the web app in streamlit framework, use:
```bash
streamlit run web.py
```

### 🔍 Visualizing Results
Results will be shown in the specified host, with visualizations of detected keypoints in a new window.
