# Requirements for Human Pose Estimation Project

## General Requirements
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher recommended.
- **IDE**: Python-compatible IDE like Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or PyCharm.

## Libraries
1. **mediapipe**: For pose detection and landmarks.
   - Installation: `pip install mediapipe`
2. **opencv-python**: For video capture and frame display.
   - Installation: `pip install opencv-python`
3. **numpy**: For mathematical computations (e.g., angles and pose data processing).
   - Installation: `pip install numpy`
4. **tensorflow**: For getting accuracy of model.
    -Installation: `pip install tensorflow`

## Hardware Requirements
- A **webcam** or external camera for real-time video input.
- **GPU** (optional but recommended) for better performance with MediaPipe.

## Optional Tools
1. **matplotlib** (optional): For visualizing key points or plots.
   - Installation: `pip install matplotlib`
2. **seaborn** (optional): For advanced plots if needed.
   - Installation: `pip install seaborn`

## System Requirements
- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB (16GB recommended for smoother operation).
- **Disk Space**: At least 2GB of free space for dependencies.
- **Operating System**: Works on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## Additional Notes
- Test your camera setup by running a basic OpenCV script to verify that the webcam feed works correctly.
- For GPU usage, ensure you have a CUDA-enabled GPU with the proper drivers installed.

# Run-Time Instructions
1. Ensure all libraries are installed as mentioned above.
2. Connect your webcam or camera and confirm it is working.
3. Run the pose estimation script in your chosen IDE or environment.
